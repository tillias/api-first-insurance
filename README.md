API-first practical approach to building insurance claims handling process

Low-Code and API-first are a very hot topics at the moment. In this article Iâ€™d like to show you a practical example of how to design APIs for some basic insurance claim handling process, how to mock this APIs and finally how to start experimenting with your business process to identify bottlenecks and possible pitfalls. Remember, fail-fast is the king before you start any initiative, be it small refactoring or global enterprise transformation.

We will need zero Java / Scala / Kotlin codig skills, though we will learn modern technological stack wich enables all this low-code beauty: Apicurio Studio, Apicurio Schema Registry, Microcks, Camunda, Kubernetes, Docker, Java, Spring Boot and some other technologies. We will be using both OpenAPI Specification or AsyncAPI Specification to define our APIs.
